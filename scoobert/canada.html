      <p>
        Doesn’t Canada sound like a maple-syrup soaked wonderland?<br /><br />
        Filled with friendly Mounties and declarations of “oh sorry.”
        Delightfully polite with a pretty prime minister who doesn’t hate
        humanity, equipped with a healthcare system that won’t bend your arm,
        and stocked with oven-fresh scone treats for the pup?<br /><br />
        A MAGA man told me, “If you don’t like it here, then move!” Hell, guy,
        come to think of it I just might. I can almost see it now, set my
        compass to follow the funky bass line and bring along my trusty canine
        companion. (But still being kinda bummed about it, I’ll have to craft a
        sound-bath prophylactic to manage the heavy feels.) <br /><br />"Moving
        to Canada" is a song to whistle on the way, a spirited serenade to help
        traverse the trail toward the last outpost of reindeer and redemption.

        About Scoobert Doobert
      </h3>
    <div class="bio">
      <p>
        Like the majestic poinsettia, I (Scoobert Doobert) was birthed from the
        sandy soil of Encinitas, California. It’s a rad little beach town, most
        famous for its great surf and fringe- religious communities. One of our
        main beaches, Swami’s, is named after Guru Paramahansa Yogananda. (No, I
        have no idea how to pronounce this.) There’s also a bunch of crazy
        public art. One day a mural of a surfing Madonna appeared on the wall of
        a pizza joint. Another time a lame surfer statue showed up in Cardiff.
        Us Encinitans quickly made the Cardiff Kook our own...<br><br>As a young-gun, I
        played guitar in garages throughout Encinitas. Eventually the cops said
        I needed to stop. There aren’t many practice spaces around here so the
        gang and I would break into churches after hours to jam with their gear.
        We gigged around at schools and coffee shops until my band mates moved
        away for college. I decided to learn to play drums and bass, so I could
        jam with myself. I pretty much just did that for the last five years.
        Blazing, surfing, writing, recording, missing my friends, and wrapping
        burritos (day job). I started digging some of the stuff I was making,
        but still didn’t have a name for the project.<br><br>Then my girlfriend said
        these fateful words, “Did you know Scooby Doo’s real name is Scoobert
        Doobert?”<br><br>I didn’t. It hit me hard. Still reeling from it.<br><br>I named my
        guitar Scoobert Doobert to spread awareness and to honor that most
        genius cartoon. I hope you enjoy its music.
